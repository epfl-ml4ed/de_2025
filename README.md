# Digital Education: Student Modeling
Student Modeling (BKT) lecture for the Digital Education course on November 11th, 2025.  
Instructors: Prof. Tanja Käser, Marta Knežević from the ML4ED Lab  

To make the lecture demonstration interactive, we'll run code on EPFL's interactive Jupyter Notebook cluster, [Noto](https://noto.epfl.ch)! Noto enables everyone to run python code in their browser, without needing an environment set up on your own machine. Here are the steps to get started with Noto.  

### Setup
Through the following steps, you will log in to Noto, copy the right files you need for the tutorial, and get started running code. 

1. Go to the [noto.epfl.ch](https://noto.epfl.ch) website.
2. You will see a login screen with a big red button called `Sign in with Tequila/SWITCHaai`. Press this button.

3. You will then see the following loading screen. Wait for less than a minute (usually) until your server spins up!

4. Now, you will be presented with a JupyterLab environment. Click on the git symbol (diamond with branches) on the left column.

5. Click on the "Clone a Repository" blue button (third one).

6. You will see a popup called "Clone a repo". In the space for a URL, copy-paste the following URL: https://github.com/epfl-ml4ed/de_2025.git. Then click the "Clone" button.

7. Great! Now you've reached the step where you have all the files you need. Click on the `de_2025` folder where all the code is located.  
8. If it asks you to "Select Kernel", please select the `Python3` Kernel from the dropdown menu. You can also select a kernel by clicking on the top right corner of the notebook.

You're all set!
